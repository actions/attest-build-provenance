# System requirements

The general configuration for running a Polygon full node is to have **at least** 4 CPUs/cores and 16 GB of RAM.

In terms of space, for a full node youâ€™ll need from **2.5 to 5 terabytes of SSD (or faster) storage**.

# Available ports

The peer exchange for a Polygon full node generally depends on **port 30303 and 26656** being open. When you configure your firewall or security groups for AWS, make sure these ports are open along with whatever ports you need to access the machine.
