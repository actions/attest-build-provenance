Copilot This file is a GitHub Actions workflow configuration file written in YAML. It defines a continuous integration pipeline for the repository. Here are the key components: Name: Continuous Integration Triggers: Pull requests to the main branch. Pushes to the main branch and branches that match the pattern releases/*. Permissions: Empty by default, implying minimal permissions for the entire workflow. Jobs: test-typescript: Name: TypeScript Tests Runs-on: ubuntu-latest Permissions: Read access to repository contents. Steps: Checkout the repository. Setup Node.js using a version specified in .node-version and cache npm modules. Install dependencies using npm ci. Check code format. Lint the code. Run tests. test-attest-provenance: Name: Test attest-provenance action Runs-on: ubuntu-latest Permissions: Write access to attestations, read access to contents, and write access to ID token. Steps: Checkout the repository. Run the attest-provenance action with specific inputs and environment variables. Dump the output using jq to process JSON. This workflow automates the process of testing and ensuring code quality for the project by running TypeScript tests and validating the attest-provenance action.
