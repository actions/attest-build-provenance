  content: |
    ### Contribution License Agreement
    This Contribution License Agreement (**“Agreement”**) is agreed to by the party signing below (**“You”**),
    and conveys certain license rights to Microsoft Corporation and its affiliates (“Microsoft”) for Your
    contributions to Microsoft open source projects. This Agreement is effective as of the latest signature
    date below.
    1. **Definitions**.
    **“Code”** means the computer software code, whether in human-readable or machine-executable form,
    that is delivered by You to Microsoft under this Agreement.
    **“Project”** means any of the projects owned or managed by Microsoft and offered under a license
    approved by the Open Source Initiative (www.opensource.org).
    **“Submit”** is the act of uploading, submitting, transmitting, or distributing code or other content to any
    Project, including but not limited to communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control
    systems, and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the Project for the purpose of
    discussing and improving that Project, but excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or
    otherwise designated in writing by You as “Not a Submission.”
    **“Submission”** means the Code and any other copyrightable material Submitted by You, including any
    associated comments and documentation.
    2. **Your Submission**. You must agree to the terms of this Agreement before making a Submission to any
    Project. This Agreement covers any and all Submissions that You, now or in the future (except as
    described in Section 4 below), Submit to any Project.
    3. **Originality of Work**. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work.
    Should You wish to Submit materials that are not Your original work, You may Submit them separately
    to the Project if You (a) retain all copyright and license information that was in the materials as You
    received them, (b) in the description accompanying Your Submission, include the phrase “Submission
    containing materials of a third party:” followed by the names of the third party and any licenses or other
    restrictions of which You are aware, and (c) follow any other instructions in the Project’s written
    guidelines concerning Submissions.
    4. **Your Employer**. References to “employer” in this Agreement include Your employer or anyone else
    for whom You are acting in making Your Submission, e.g. as a contractor, vendor, or agent. If Your
    Submission is made in the course of Your work for an employer or Your employer has intellectual
    property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable law, You must secure permission from Your
    employer to make the Submission before signing this Agreement. In that case, the term “You” in this
    Agreement will refer to You and the employer collectively. If You change employers in the future and
    desire to Submit additional Submissions for the new employer, then You agree to sign a new Agreement
    and secure permission from the new employer before Submitting those Submissions.
    5. **Licenses**.
      * **Copyright License**. You grant Microsoft, and those who receive the Submission directly or
    indirectly from Microsoft, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license in the
    Submission to reproduce, prepare derivative works of, publicly display, publicly perform, and distribute
    the Submission and such derivative works, and to sublicense any or all of the foregoing rights to third
    parties.
      * **Patent License**. You grant Microsoft, and those who receive the Submission directly or
    indirectly from Microsoft, a perpetual, worldwide, non-exclusive, royalty-free, irrevocable license under
    Your patent claims that are necessarily infringed by the Submission or the combination of the
    Submission with the Project to which it was Submitted to make, have made, use, offer to sell, sell and
    import or otherwise dispose of the Submission alone or with the Project.
      * **Other Rights Reserved**. Each party reserves all rights not expressly granted in this Agreement.
    No additional licenses or rights whatsoever (including, without limitation, any implied licenses) are
    granted by implication, exhaustion, estoppel or otherwise.
    6. **Representations and Warranties**. You represent that You are legally entitled to grant the above
    licenses. You represent that each of Your Submissions is entirely Your original work (except as You may
    have disclosed under Section 3). You represent that You have secured permission from Your employer to
    make the Submission in cases where Your Submission is made in the course of Your work for Your
    employer or Your employer has intellectual property rights in Your Submission by contract or applicable
    law. If You are signing this Agreement on behalf of Your employer, You represent and warrant that You
    have the necessary authority to bind the listed employer to the obligations contained in this Agreement.
    You are not expected to provide support for Your Submission, unless You choose to do so. UNLESS
    REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING, AND EXCEPT FOR THE WARRANTIES
    EXPRESSLY STATED IN SECTIONS 3, 4, AND 6, THE SUBMISSION PROVIDED UNDER THIS AGREEMENT IS
    PROVIDED WITHOUT WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO, ANY WARRANTY OF
    NONINFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, OR FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR PURPOSE.
    7. **Notice to Microsoft**. You agree to notify Microsoft in writing of any facts or circumstances of which
    You later become aware that would make Your representations in this Agreement inaccurate in any
    respect.
    8. **Information about Submissions**. You agree that contributions to Projects and information about
    contributions may be maintained indefinitely and disclosed publicly, including Your name and other
    information that You submit with Your Submission.
    9. **Governing Law/Jurisdiction**. This Agreement is governed by the laws of the State of Washington, and
    the parties consent to exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the federal courts sitting in King County,
    Washington, unless no federal subject matter jurisdiction exists, in which case the parties consent to
    exclusive jurisdiction and venue in the Superior Court of King County, Washington. The parties waive all
    defenses of lack of personal jurisdiction and forum non-conveniens.
    10. **Entire Agreement/Assignment**. This Agreement is the entire agreement between the parties, and
    supersedes any and all prior agreements, understandings or communications, written or oral, between
    the parties relating to the subject matter hereof. This Agreement may be assigned by Microsoft.

<!-- BEGIN MICROSOFT SECURITY.MD V0.0.9 BLOCK -->

## Security

Microsoft takes the security of our software products and services seriously, which includes all source code repositories managed through our GitHub organizations, which include [Microsoft](https://github.com/Microsoft), [Azure](https://github.com/Azure), [DotNet](https://github.com/dotnet), [AspNet](https://github.com/aspnet) and [Xamarin](https://github.com/xamarin).

If you believe you have found a security vulnerability in any Microsoft-owned repository that meets [Microsoft's definition of a security vulnerability](https://aka.ms/security.md/definition), please report it to us as described below.

## Reporting Security Issues

**Please do not report security vulnerabilities through public GitHub issues.**

Instead, please report them to the Microsoft Security Response Center (MSRC) at [https://msrc.microsoft.com/create-report](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/create-report).

If you prefer to submit without logging in, send email to [secure@microsoft.com](mailto:secure@microsoft.com).  If possible, encrypt your message with our PGP key; please download it from the [Microsoft Security Response Center PGP Key page](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/pgp).

You should receive a response within 24 hours. If for some reason you do not, please follow up via email to ensure we received your original message. Additional information can be found at [microsoft.com/msrc](https://www.microsoft.com/msrc). 

Please include the requested information listed below (as much as you can provide) to help us better understand the nature and scope of the possible issue:

  * Type of issue (e.g. buffer overflow, SQL injection, cross-site scripting, etc.)
  * Full paths of source file(s) related to the manifestation of the issue
  * The location of the affected source code (tag/branch/commit or direct URL)
  * Any special configuration required to reproduce the issue
  * Step-by-step instructions to reproduce the issue
  * Proof-of-concept or exploit code (if possible)
  * Impact of the issue, including how an attacker might exploit the issue

This information will help us triage your report more quickly.

If you are reporting for a bug bounty, more complete reports can contribute to a higher bounty award. Please visit our [Microsoft Bug Bounty Program](https://aka.ms/security.md/msrc/bounty) page for more details about our active programs.

## Preferred Languages

We prefer all communications to be in English.

## Policy

Microsoft follows the principle of [Coordinated Vulnerability Disclosure](https://aka.ms/security.md/cvd).
