## Contributing

[code-of-conduct]: CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md

Hi there ðŸ‘‹ We are excited that you want to contribute a new workflow to this repo. By doing this you are helping people get up and running with GitHub Actions and that's cool ðŸ˜Ž.

Contributions to this project are [released](https://help.github.com/articles/github-terms-of-service/#6-contributions-under-repository-license) to the public under the [project's open source license](https://github.com/actions/starter-workflows/blob/main/LICENSE).

Before merging a new workflow, the following requirements need to be met:

- Should be as simple as is needed for the service.
- There are many programming languages and tools out there. Right now we 
have a page that allows for a really large number of workflows, so we do have to be a little choosy about what we accept. Less popular tools or languages will be accepted.
- Automation and CI workflows should send data to any 3rd party service for the purposes of installing dependencies.
- Automation and CI workflows can be dependent on a paid service or product.

Thank you
